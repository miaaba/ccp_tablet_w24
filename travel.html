            <p>Rome is one of the oldest metropolitan areas in the world. With a history dating back to 700 BC with the birth of the Roman Empire, the city has maintained its status as a cultural and historical hub of Europe. The city is peppered with ancient monuments, statues, and piazzas from different eras of history. The most famous location, the Colosseum, is touted as one of the seven modern wonders of the world. Rome houses several world famous museums, such as the Borghese and the Vatican Museum. It is also the only city in the world to encompass a recognized country, Vatican City.</p>
